- need a schedule a call button that prompts user to schedule with us (example
msp i found uses calendly for scheduling, maybe we could use a tool like that)
- Get Started Button to get a free, instant quote (Has user fill out
Name, email, company name, phone, and prompts "How can we help you" Text box)
-reviews section (that probably comes later)
- What we do section lists all offered services
-Could use a sloagan (theirs is "Proactive approach to technology, do I still
want to use "Set IT and Forget IT IT?" Not bad, but who knows)
- They have 4 blocks that say IT consulting, Managed IT services, Cloud solutions, and cyber security
-This particular MSP holds a SOC 2 Type 2 Certification (research that more later)
(will a SOC 2 Type 2 cert function like a regular cloud cert that i'm used to? I should research that more, it potentially could train me on essentially how to run an MSP? What cert or individual trainign resources can i put myself through to be prepped to run this MSP and provide these services confidently?)
-They have a lengthy list of impressive parterners, intuit, Dell, Microsoft, vmware, etc. etc. (i'm curious if applying for a partnership is somethign I should be considering right now when I barely have the MSP off the ground and I dont have any clients yet? Is that something that comes later? Or will applying for a partnership actually help me launch this business faster? I think it's clearly great for credibility, i wonder if it can make me money?)
- thier about us page is relatively lengthy and detailed
- recoginitionsa and awards are proudly displayed

-THey have a youtube video inside their website, it looks like a video to explain "why us" it looks professional and I like that the CEO shows his face
- They have a career section where you seemingly can apply for a job to join them
- they have a robust social media network (ig, facebook, twitter, youtube, linkedin, and seem to be posting on it frequeuntly (even shortform skit content on their youtube related to tech, a nice touch))
